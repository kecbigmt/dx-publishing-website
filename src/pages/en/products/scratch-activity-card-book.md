This book is a programming learning card book that combines guides and coding cards for cycle of imagine, create and share on the projects. We have developed a series of four card books to help students to engage continuously their "Creative learning ".

The code (i.e. program) that is written on the cards is so simple that it takes only a few steps, so that students able to get  the concept of computational thinking while enjoying.

It also has the following features.

* Contains state-of-the-art programming learning materials developed by the Scratch Team (scratch.mit.edu) .
* The long-awaited scratch 3.0 compatible Japanese coding card.
* Easy access to introduction videos and shared projects with QR.
* It is ideal for educational printed materials in elementary schools and after-school programs.
* It is ideal for online education classes. Pre-printed materials facilitate interactive communication between students and teachers at remote locations.

Coding Cards are teaching materials for Scratch activities designed according to the "Four Guiding Principle", which is the basis of creative learning. It consists of “Project”, “Passion”, “Peers” and “Play”. The four Ps are the elements needed to develop creative thinking. 

In addition, this book aims to be meterials like a Froebel gift for practicing "Montessori education," which fosters children's willingness to continue learning.

Based on this concept, we created the card books as a teaching material that brings "Creative Learning" to students. Just keep it handy and it will help students to concentrate to engage on programming by themselves.

By using this book, students will be able to spontaneously create projects, develop logical thinking skills, be interested in digital music and digital art, and enhance their communication skills.
