## Create the books

### It's the reader who decides what a great book is
Readers want diversity and agility.

The current publishing system, in which publishers and editors decide to publish books from a business perspective, cannot meet these diversified needs and agility. Since there are many processes from the planning of writing / translation to the line up of books at bookstores, and the involvement of many companies. The reader has to wait a long time for the book to arrive.

By the time they reach our readers, many of these books are out of date.

### Digital transformation of the publishing industry
The culture of Japanese companies, which can only be decided by a collegial system, has hampered the efforts of digital transformation, and Japanese companies are starting to fall behind the world.

The publishing industry hasn't tackled digital transformation either. Now, digital publishing software is also available at a low price, and by using a print-on-demand mechanism for printing, the author's ideas can be published quickly.

We believe that the new business model of the publishing industry is the new style of publishing that responds to diversifying reader needs by utilizing print-on-demand.

### Why we need printed books?
The spread of smartphones and the expansion of subscription services have made it easier for us to read e-books, but books printed as paper media bring various value to readers. Information read with e-books is hard to remember and can be forgotten in a short period of time, but printed books exist for decades not only when they are read, It reminds us of our memory when we read the books.

## Mission
We will help to increase the number of children who are interested in learning and having spirit of inquiry by providing quality learning materials and books. For this, we will find good books and deliver them to our readers quickly.
